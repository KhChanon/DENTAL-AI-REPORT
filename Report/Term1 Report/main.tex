\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Keywords}
\quad Keywords: Oral Surgery, Dentistry, Diagnose, Follow-up, Artificial Intelligence, Chatbot, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing

\section{Problem Statement}
  \subsection{Problem Statement and Motivation}
    \quad Individuals seeking healthcare in today's world often run into a number of challenges while attempting to acquire correct information regarding their symptoms and appropriate treatment. Many patients have minor illnesses or symptoms that might not necessarily require immediate medical attention from a doctor. Nevertheless, these individuals usually resort to clinics or hospitals for a diagnosis as there is a lack of information and assistance available. \par
    \quad This rise in patient visits not only places a considerable burden on healthcare facilities but also results in financial implications for patients themselves. The associated costs, such as consultation fees, diagnostic tests, and travel expenses, can impose an unreasonable financial strain on individuals. Moreover, this increased demand for medical attention has contributed to an imbalance in the doctor-to-patient ratio, affecting the overall quality of healthcare services provided. According to the National Statistical Office, the ratio of doctor-to-patient ratio is 1 to 8,057.\par
    \quad Furthermore, the challenges do not cease once treatment is initiated. After receiving medical care, many patients still have many concerns about their health conditions. Many patients desire prompt answers to their worries about their conditions. In addition to these concerns, patients often have recurring questions, commonly categorized as frequently asked questions (FAQs).\par
    \quad Regrettably, doctors and medical staff find themselves overwhelmed by the immense workload caused from the increased patient influx. As they aim to deliver quality care and diagnosis, they may have limited time and resources to respond satisfactorily to the patients.\par
    \quad To address these pressing issues and enhance the healthcare experience for both patients and healthcare providers, we were motivated to develop an application that can effectively address these issues. The application will have the capability to diagnose common diseases and answer frequently asked questions from the patient's symptoms. Additionally, it will feature a chatbot designed to follow up on patient conditions after surgery.\par


  \subsection{Potential Benefits}
    \quad The purpose of this dental application is to reduce frequently asked questions from patients regarding oral symptoms or diseases and also help with post-surgery follow-up thus reducing the workload of the dentist and medical staff. Dentists can use the extra time they gain to concentrate on patients who require more extensive care.\par
    \quad In addition to the benefits that doctors receive from this application, patients and the general public also get their benefit as they have immediate access to oral diagnosis and knowledge. Since patients can understand their symptoms and get guidance on simple treatments, this helps to decrease needless doctor visits. Moreover, it can benefit patients by decreasing the expense of visiting the doctor to get a diagnosis. Another benefit that patients receive is continuous monitoring of their symptoms, which allows their doctor to be informed of any unexpected post-surgery problems.\par

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item To acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for developing an AI-powered chatbot. 
  \item To build a chatbot specialized in providing accurate answers to specific dental questions.
  \item To reduce doctors and staff by minimizing repeated questions and explanations from patients.
  \item try
\end{itemize}
